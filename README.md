# crystal-game

The object of this game is to reach the random number generated without going over.

A random number between 19 and 120 is generated and shown in a box.

There are four pictures of crystals, and each has a random value between 1 and 12.  The values are not shown and are only known when clicked on and the total added to the total box.

If the total reached is equal to the random number the player wins and one win is added to their score.

If the total reached is more than the randomo number the player loses and one loss is added to their score.

As soon as the player wins or loses the game restarts and new random numbers are generated.
